### Configuration

This app requires a dedicated root domain.

Nitter config file is stored in `/var/www/nitter/nitter.conf` (for the first instance, subsequent installs will go in `nitter__2`, `nitter__3`, etc). Users can override the defaults and set custom settings at `https://instance-domain.tld/settings`.
